## Learning Some Alternatives Libraries for Making HTTP Request


Here you can try 4 libraries for making HTTP Requests. These modules include:
***
### HTTPS

```
npm i https
```
***
### Request
```
npm i request
```
***
### Superagent
```
npm i superagent
```
***
### Axios
```
npm i axios
```
***
to try the code in this repo, you just execute

```
node [filename].js
```

in terminal/command prompt

***

I have written the required libraries in package.json so you can simply execute the following command to download the libraries

```
npm update
```
